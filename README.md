## Project Overview

### Animation

For the **BigStat count-up animation**, I used:

https://www.reactbits.dev/text-animations/count-up

This provides a lightweight, performant number animation while keeping the component logic clean and readable.

All animation usage was kept intentional and minimal to maintain performance and avoid unnecessary complexity.
